            Hello! Thank you for opening your **first PR** to Astroâ€™s Docs! ðŸŽ‰

            Hereâ€™s what will happen next:

            1. Our GitHub bots will run to check your changes.
               If they spot any broken links you will see some error messages on this PR.
               Donâ€™t hesitate to ask any questions if youâ€™re not sure what these mean!
            
            2. In a few minutes, youâ€™ll be able to see a preview of your changes on Netlify ðŸ¥³
            
            3. One or more of our maintainers will take a look and may ask you to make changes.
               We try to be responsive, but donâ€™t worry if this takes a few days.
